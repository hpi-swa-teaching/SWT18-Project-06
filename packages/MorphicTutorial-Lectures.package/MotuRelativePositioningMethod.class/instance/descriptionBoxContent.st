	^ '<b>Advanced Positioning once again</b><br>Naturaly, what you learned in the last lecture is something we are going to write quite often. To help ourselves we could invent a subclass of Morph that could handle positioning relative to a given other morph. Let us do that. Implement the method position: aPoint relativeTo: aMorph on  <a href="code://MotuPositionMorph">MotuPositionMorph</a>.<br>After solving it, the red Morph will be positioned relative to the white Morph in the white Morph, so it moves to the bottom edge of the white morph using your method!<br>You can use this Morph in the lectures hereafter and build the same behaviour in your own Morphs later, if you want to.' asHtmlText

	^ '<b>Advanced Positioning once again</b><br>
Naturally, what you learned in the last lecture is something we are going to write quite often. To help ourselves, we could invent a subclass of Morph that can handle positioning relative to a given other morph. Let''s do exactly that.<br>
<br>
Implement the method <a href="code://MotuPositionMorph >> #position:relativeTo:">MotuPositionMorph>>position:relativeTo:</a>.<br>
<br>
We will then use your method to place the red Morph inside the white Morph.<br>You can use this method in the lectures hereafter.' asTextFromHtml

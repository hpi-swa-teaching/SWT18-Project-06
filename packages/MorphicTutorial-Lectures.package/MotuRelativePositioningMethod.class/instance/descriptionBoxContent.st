	^ '<b>Advanced Positioning once again</b><br>
Naturally, what you learned in the last lecture is something we are going to write quite often. To help ourselves we could invent a subclass of Morph that could handle positioning relative to a given other morph. Let us do that.<br>
<br>
Implement the method <a href="code://MotuPositionMorph >> #position:relativeTo:">position: aPoint relativeTo: aMorph</a> in the class <a href="code://MotuPositionMorph">MotuPositionMorph</a>.<br>
<br>
We will then use your method to place the red Morph inside the white Morph.<br>You can use this Morph in the lectures hereafter and build the same behaviour in your own Morphs later, if you want to.' asTextFromHtml

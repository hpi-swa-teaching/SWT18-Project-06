	^ '<b>Explore the depths of a Morph</b><br>Have you ever wondered, how you can look into a Morph and find every deep secret it has? Now, it will be time to do it! In Squeak, you have the ability to inspect and explore windows, text fields, buttons ... simply everything. With the halo of the morph you can open the exploring window, where you will find all informations about this morph. Be aware, that the Morph you have to explore is a submorph of the Playfield, which is also a submorph of the tutorial window. Your task is to explore the Morph you see in the field and find out what the <b>color, width and height</b> is. Then set those attributes on the morph you get from us to the same values like the morph you see. (<i>Tipp:</i> If you can not find an attribut or you just want to be faster, you can execute code with the self context of the morph in the exploring window e.g. "self position" will show you the exact position of the morph in the world.)' asHtmlText

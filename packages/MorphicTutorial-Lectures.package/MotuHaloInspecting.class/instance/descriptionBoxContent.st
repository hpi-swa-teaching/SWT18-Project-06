	^ '<b>Explore the depths of a Morph</b><br>
Have you ever wondered, how you can look into a Morph and find every deep secret it has? Now, it will be time to do it!<br>
In Squeak, you have the ability to inspect and explore windows, text fields, buttons ... simply everything.<br>
You can open the Halo of a Morph by using either <i>Alt-Click or Middle-click</i>.<br>
With the halo of the morph you can open the Inspector window, where you will find all information about the selected Morph. Be aware, that the Morph you have to explore is a submorph of the Playfield, which is also a submorph of the tutorial window, which means you might have to use Alt-click/Middle-click multiple times until the right Morph is selected.<br>
<br>
Your task is to explore the Morph you see in the field and find out what its <i><a href="code://Morph >> #color">color</a>, <a href="code://Morph >> #width">width</a> and <a href="code://Morph >> #height">height</a></i> are. Then set those attributes on the Morph you get from us to the values you see.<br>
<br> 
(Hint: If you cannot find an attribute or you just want to be faster, you can execute code with the self context of the morph in the exploring window, e.g. <i>"self position"</i> will show you the exact position of the morph in the world.)' asTextFromHtml

The moving Morph is a submorph of the stationary one. <br> Lets imagine that the static one is a view into a scenery where the other Morph is moving. Now we dont want to see the moving morph if he is out of sight. <br> The concept of clipping exists in the Morphic Framework and is represented by the property clipSubmorphs.' asTextFromHtml

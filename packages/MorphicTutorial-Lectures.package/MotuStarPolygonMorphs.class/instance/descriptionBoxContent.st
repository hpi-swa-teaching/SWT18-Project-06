	^ '<b>Stars</b><br>
As you have seen in the previous lecture, you can pass points as vertices to the PolygonMorph.<br>
<br>
In this lecture your task is to create and return a <a href="code://PolygonMorph">PolygonMorph</a> that looks like a star.<br>
<br>
Your Morph will be displayed in the playground and an algorithm will check if it looks like a star.<br>
Hint: A star has at least 3 tips and its color is yellow.' asTextFromHtml

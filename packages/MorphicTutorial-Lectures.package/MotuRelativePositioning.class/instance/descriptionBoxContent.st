	^ '<b>Advanced Positioning</b><br>Actually, we cheated in the last lecture. When we introduces positioning to you, we pretended, that the Morph would be at its position relative to its owner position. That is not the case. Positions are always relative to the upper left screen corner. That means depending on how you positioned the window, the morph at 100@50 would not even be in the visible area of its parent.<br>To fix this, you just need to add the position (relative to the owner) onto the owners position.<br>Try it and set the Morph you get from us to the position x=200 und y=100, but this time do it relative to the playgound we give to you.<br><br>Hint: To get the owners position you need to get the owner. How do you get the owner of a given <a href="code://Morph">Morph</a>?' asHtmlText

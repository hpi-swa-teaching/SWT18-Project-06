	^ '<b>Click me more</b><br>
While the solution from the last excercise works for a single instance of the colorful morph, it has no effect on new instances that are created. When you click the morph above, nothing will happen.<br>

<br>
Your task is to implement <a href="code://ColorfulMorph >> #handlesMouseDown:">ColorfulMorph>>handlesMouseDown:</a>.' asTextFromHtml

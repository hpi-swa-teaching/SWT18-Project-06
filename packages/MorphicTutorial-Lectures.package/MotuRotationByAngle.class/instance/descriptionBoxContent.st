	^ '<b>Rotation</b><br>
Now that you learned that a Morph needs a flex shell to be rotated, lets actually rotate a Morph. You can achieve this using the method <a href="code://TransformMorph >> #angle:">TransformMorph>>angle:</a>.<br>
<br>
The Morph we give you already has a flex shell. Rotate the given Morph clockwise by 30 degrees.' asTextFromHtml

	^ '<b>In position!</b><br>
In this lecture you get a Morph from us. (But remember that Morphs are created through <i>"Morph new"</i>. Just so you do not forget. Moreover, Morphs have to be opened in a world or added to another Morph.)<br>
<br>
In this lecture you do not bother with creating a Morph - we take care of it behind the scenes. Here we only want to look at properties of Morphs and how to manipulate them. Especially coordinates.<br>
<br>
Set the <a href="code://Morph">Morph</a> you get from us to the position x=100 und y=50.' asTextFromHtml

Moreover, Morphs have to be opened in a world or added to another <i>Morph</i>.) In this lecture you do not bother with that and we take care of it behind the scenes. Here we only want to look at properties of <i>Morph</i>s and how to manipulate them. Especially coordinates.<br>Set the Morph you get from us to the position x=100 und y=50.' asHtmlText

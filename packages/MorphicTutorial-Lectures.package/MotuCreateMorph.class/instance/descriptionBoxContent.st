	^ '<b>Let us build a Morph</b><br>
In this first lecture we want to create a <a href="code://Morph">Morph</a> and show it to the user. In order to create a Morph we call "new" on the class - just as we do for every instance of a class in Squeak. Then open the Morph in the current world. We have changed the current world to be the tutorial world. Outside of this tutorial opening a Morph in the current world will just use the normal world.<br>
<br>
Do not forget to return your Morph to us using the return character <b>^</b> , so we can exhibit it in our gallery of first Morphs.' asTextFromHtml

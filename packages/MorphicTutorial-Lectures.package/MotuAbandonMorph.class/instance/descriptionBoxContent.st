	^ '<b>Abandon a Morph</b><br>Now that you have learned to create a Morph and display it you need to let it disappear again. There are two methods that could potentially be used for this task. The first is to use the delete method. The second possibility is to make use of the abandon method. Since the abandon method is there to be overridden by subclasses of morph in order to clean up resources and then call delete. You should rather use the abandon method. With abandon you can be sure that everything is "deleted" gracefully. Let the Morph we provide you with disappear using abandon.' asHtmlText
